# 8-bit-ALU
An 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a combinational circuit that performs arithmetic and logic operations on 8-bit inputs. It can execute various functions like addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and multiplication based on a control signal. The ALU produces an 8-bit output, along with flags such as a zero flag to indicate when the result is zero. It plays a critical role in processors, enabling fundamental operations necessary for data manipulation.
